Problem Solving, a course for Computer Science Elite class in Nanjing University.
## PSterm2
This is the second term I started coding.
My coding style can be read now, though still difficult to read.
I spend some time(not too much) learning C/C++ and some algorithms at the winter vacation after term1.
That's the first time I want to participate in ACM icpc contest.
(And this dream comes true after one year.)
