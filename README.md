Just for a commemorate.

2019NJUPC
The 16th Nanjing University Programming Contest(南京大学第16届算法设计竞赛)

I participate as an individual contestant of public group(div2).
I passed problem A,B,E,F,G, the 4th.

I solved other problems after the contest, with the help of solution.

Files conclude 
- origin.cpp, that's the code I solved the problem the first time.
- improve.cpp, that's the code I rewrite to improve readability and performance.

Because of security, the content of problems won't be shown. If you're a student in Nanjing University, you can join the ACM ICPC team and ask for a copy or a pdf of problem set.

Some problems needs special judge, which can't be supported by our training OJ. Thus I haven't solved them, they are listed at the end.
Unsolve special judge problems:
- A. Blackjack (div1)
- G. NJU Emulator (div1)
- H. Road Construction (div1/2)
