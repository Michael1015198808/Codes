Problem Solving, a course for Computer Science Elite class in Nanjing University.
## PSterm1
This is the first term I started coding. I have nearly no experience with coding(if cmd line in Windows can be count)
This term, my code style is terrible.
I pass 3/4 problems in the final exam.
(The unsolved problem needs using linked list, I know nearly nothing about pointer at that time)
